# Conversion_Rate_Optimization
## Data
The dataset contains information about users who hit an ecommerce site. We know some of their characteristics, such as their country, marketing channel, age, whether they are repeat users, and the number of pages visited during that session. We also know whether they converted or not.

## Project Description 
Build a model to predict the binary outcome(converted or not). Based on the model result, come up with recommendations to improve conversion rate.
